# FoundryVTTMgmt
A git for automating management tasks for Foundry VTT hosts on cloud service providers


My last foundyvtt instance was an amazon ec2 ubuntu instance with node installed. It was simple and worked, except when broke it or eventually i ran out of dree credits.

Migrating was tough.

this repo will store my scripts for setting a docker host on azure for easier future migration.
